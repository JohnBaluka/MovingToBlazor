                    <br />

Blazor provides a web development standard that can be applied to mobile, web, or desktop applications.</span>

On the server-side, organizations have sacrificed performance to use node.js with JavaScript, instead of, a compiled, and very performant, .NET application written in C#. On the client-side, organizations would choose React, Angular, or Vue.js, because they were the best options a few years ago. For organizations that prefer the Microsoft Tech Stack, Blazor is now usually the best choice.</span>

No matter which codebase you are coming from, or evolving, software development teams should take an iterative approach and deliver updates frequently. I can help with all these aspects.</span>

There is the Blazor Client that uses Web Assembly (WASM) and Blazor Server that uses SignalR. Both are strong options when your web site needs to be interactive like a true application. For user interactions, WASM provides the most optimized client-side processing and SignalR provides the most optimized server-side processing. Meaning, WASM provides one extreme and SignalR is the other extreme.</span>
                    <br />

Where WASM is weak, SignalR is strong, and vice versa.</span>

Scheduling a Workshop is the best place to start. This allows you and your team to work through the tough questions and make the necessary decisions to move forward. The price for a Workshop is within four figures, and the average engagement is usually two sessions to where each session is between one and two hours to get the results you expect. The second session is more like a follow-up session.</span>

A Cohort consists of a one-hour weekly session, a channel over Microsoft Teams and content to watch prior to each session. The price for a Cohort is within five figures per person and usually spans between four and twelve weeks.</span>
